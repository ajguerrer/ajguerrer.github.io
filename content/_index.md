### Hello!

I'm a software engineer currently working at Spectra Logic. I started working there as an intern
while completing my Bachelor of Science Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
Colorado. Along the way, I developed a passion for software engineering while working close to the
hardware.

At Spectra, I maintain fancy jukeboxes (a.k.a SCSI Medium Changers) storing some of the world's most
important data. Inside is a distributed system, custom built from the ground up, composed of
multiple protocols and transports where clusters of sensors and motors (robots) scramble to load
tape media into drives. We call them tape libraries.

Much of my focus is directed internally toward my teammates. Running on those tape libraries is an
atomic fully upgradable Yocto-based Linux distribution I developed and maintain so my team always
has the tools and features they need to write awesome software. I also rewrote a build system from a
collection of Perl and Ruby scripts to composable, declarative Jenkins pipelines, while
simultaneously migrating the codebase from Perforce to GitHub. Combined with an simple, consistent
workflow, my teammates develop in a more familiar environment with a tighter feedback loop. Next
stop for Jenkins is the cloud!

Recently, I have developed quite the hankering for the Rust programming language. In the past couple
years, I have been learning Rust through a couple personal projects in my free time - including a
reflective protobuf library and a async network stack. Feel free to check them out!

      <description>Test Reliability  Test binary size and memory usage, including third-party testing tools, have a strong correlation on whether a test is flaky. 1 Beware of using UI testing to verify underlying functionality. In these cases, it is cheaper and more reliable to have smaller tests that break closer to the source of the problem.2 3  Productivity  Releasing often gives teams an incentive to automate testing and reduce coupling with the rest of the system.</description>

Dependency Injection A testable class is one that can be constructed in isolation or with test double collaborators. Once constructed, they have all the dependencies they need. This is known as Dependency Injection.
Dependencies do not need to be concrete classes. Abstract classes allow testers to leverage inheritance for creating test double collaborators. This is the primary tool in a testers toolkit and the primary benefit Dependency Injection brings.</description>

      <description>The Seven Plagues of Software Testing  Aimlessness - Do not test for the sake of testing. Every test should have a goal. Document what works and analyze what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Then, share with your colleagues.1 Repetitiveness - Running the same test suite over again without finding new bugs does not mean that there are no bugs. Variation is healthy.2 Amnesia - Chances are the problem your are trying to solve has been solved before.</description>

Exercise Service Call Contracts in Tests November 27, 2018 - original post
If the code under test relies on the contract of a service, prefer exercising the service call instead of mocking it out. Some service owners provide a fake. Otherwise, use a hermetic server.
